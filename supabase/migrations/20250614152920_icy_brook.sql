  # Storage Policies Setup

  This migration sets up storage policies for the room-files bucket.
  Note: Storage policies should be created through the Supabase dashboard
  or using the storage API, not through SQL migrations.
  
  This file serves as documentation of the required policies.
*/

-- Storage policies cannot be created through SQL migrations due to permission restrictions.
-- Please create these policies manually in the Supabase dashboard:

-- 1. Go to Storage > room-files > Policies
-- 2. Create the following policies:

/*
Policy 1: "Authenticated users can upload files"
- Operation: INSERT
- Target roles: authenticated
- USING expression: bucket_id = 'room-files'

Policy 2: "Anyone can view files"
- Operation: SELECT
- Target roles: public
- USING expression: bucket_id = 'room-files'

Policy 3: "Authenticated users can delete files"
- Operation: DELETE
- Target roles: authenticated
- USING expression: bucket_id = 'room-files' AND auth.uid()::text = owner
