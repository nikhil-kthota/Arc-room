  # Add Delete Account Function

  1. New Function
    - `delete_user_account()` - Deletes user account and all associated data
    
  2. Security
    - Function can only be called by authenticated users
    - Deletes user's rooms, files, and storage data
    - Uses security definer to allow deletion of auth.users
